1. 10.times { |n| puts "#{" " * n} The Flintstones Rock!" }

2. Integers can't be concatenated to Strings.
   puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2).to_s

3. change the loop to while dividend > 0 do
   determines if the result has no remainder
   line 8 returns the divisors array

4. rolling_buffer1 mutates the input buffer argument whereas rolling_buffer2 does not. rolling_buffer2 also creates a new object and assigns it to the buffer variable each time the method is called.

5. The limit variable is not in the same scape as the fib method. limit should be passed into the fib method.

6. use the same operator for both expressions

7. 34

8. Yes because the Hash#[]= method is a mutating method

9. "paper"
